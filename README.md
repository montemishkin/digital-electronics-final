# digital-electronics-final

Part of a final project for my digital electronics course. Features two games written in Processing, controlled by serial data from Arduino.

This repository contains **only the writeup** for the final project.

See my [starfire](http://github.com/montemishkin/starfire) and [pepper](http://github.com/montemishkin/pepper) repos for the actual code behind these two games.
